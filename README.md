﻿## Files

Main: The file that reads one input file by command line argument and runs the Tokenizer class to output the corresponding codes to the screen.

Token:The file that reads the input by line and tokenizes each token, so it can return one token at a time to the Main.java with currentToken().

Tokenizer:The file that serves as a data structure for all tokens and contains multiple information about each token, such as their line number for error checking purposes.

Parser: The program that contains the utility functions, such as matchConsume() for the ParseTree in node representation

ProgramNode: The root node of the parse tree that initiates DeclSeqNode and StmtSeqNode 

AssignNode: The node used to assign an integer to a variable

CompNode: The node to compare values and is inside of CondNode

CondNode: The node used by if and while to create a condition

DeclNode: The nodes used to declare variables in the beginning of the program

DeclSeqNode:The node that expands to multiple DeclNode in the beginning of the program

ExprNode: The node that represents an expression in the parse tree

FacNode: The node that is used an int, id, or an expression in paranthesis

IdListNode: The node that is used to represent multiple ids separated by a comma

IdNode: The node that represents an Id

IfNode: The node that is used to represent an if or an ifElse statement

InNode: The read node that allows the user to enter variables

IntNode: The node that represents a integer variable 

LoopNode: The node that is used to represent a while loop that iterates until a condition is false

OutNode: The node that represents a write statement that prints values to the screen

StmtNode: A single statement that can be expanded to either if, while, read, write, or assignment

StmtSeqNode: The node that represents multiple statement nodes

TermNode: The node that is used to represent either a single fac or a multiplication of a fac and a term

## Compilation

Use the make file by simply type make in the project directory. This directory will contain the “src” folder that has main and nodes inside. Make will generate the bin file that has the class files. 

## Execution

To run, go to the bin file that’s generated by the make file and type java main.Main <input file> when the input files are in the bin. The Main file is in the main folder, and the project only runs inside the bin folder that contains all the executables and input files.
