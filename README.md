# SimpleInterpreter

This program is an interpreter for an elementary language CORE. The syntax is included and contains only fundamental functions.

## Main Files

**Main**: The file reads one input file by command line argument and runs the Tokenizer class to output the corresponding codes to the screen.

**Token**: The file reads the input by line and tokenizes each token to return one token at a time to the Main.java with currentToken().

**Tokenizer**: The file serves as a data structure for all tokens and contains multiple information about each token, such as their line number, for error-checking purposes.

**Parser**: The program that contains the utility functions, such as matchConsume() for the ParseTree in node representation

## Compilation

Use the make file by typing ``make``` in the project directory. This directory will contain the “src” folder with the main and node files inside. Make will generate the bin folder that has all the class files. 

## Execution

To run, go to the bin folder generated by the ```make``` command and type ```java Main <input file>```, and make sure the ```<input file>``` is in the bin. ```exampleCOREprogram.CORE``` is an example file that can be used as input. Just move that to the bin folder. The project runs inside the bin folder that contains all the executables and input files.
